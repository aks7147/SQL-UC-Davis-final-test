Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 records
ii. Business table = 10000 records
iii. Category table = 10000 records
iv. Checkin table = 10000 records
v. elite_years table = 10000 records
vi. friend table = 10000 records
vii. hours table = 10000 records
viii. photo table = 10000 records 
ix. review table = 10000 records
x. tip table = 10000 records
xi. user table = 10000 records
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 records
ii. Hours = 1562 records
iii. Category = 2643 records
iv. Attribute = 1115 records
v. Review = 8090 records
vi. Checkin = 493 records
vii. Photo = 10000 records
viii. Tip = 537 record
ix. User = 10000 records
x. Friend = 11 records
xi. Elite_years = 2780 records

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Posing more reviews does not corelate with more number of fans since we can see from below table as Gerald has more number of reviews but fans are comparatively low from others.

Below is query:-	
select
name,
review_count,
fans
from user
order by review_count desc

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
		Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
		Yes
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
		Location are different. Higher ratings are for long working hours.

SQL code used for analysis:

		select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
 group by business.stars;

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         closed business have less rating
         
ii. Difference 2:
         open business have high review count
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	select business.name,
business.review_count,
business.stars,
business.is_open,
category.category,
hours.hours,
business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id=category.business_id)
inner join hours on hours.business_id=category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa'
group by business.is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         Finding correlation between the likes with the given rates and using like in the reviews. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
         I need two sources of data (tables). First, I join these two tables based on users and business. Then I sort them based on rating to see if there is a correlation between the number of stars and likes. 
The reason I chose this analysis and thus, the data sets is that psychologists have shown that how people think about something can completely change even after a few minutes and they think that how people think just after occurrence of an event is a better representative for the quality of that event compared to what they say after thinking about it. Because tip table is related to the occurrence of the event (shopping) and they write a review after hours or even days, comparing these two tables can help us to explore the validity what psychologists claim. As the result shows there is a slight correlation between the number of likes and stars, but this correlation is not strong. So what psychologists claim seems to be fairly valid.  
		
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         +-------+-------+
| stars | likes |
+-------+-------+
|     3 |     2 |
|     5 |     2 |
|     5 |     1 |

+-------+-------+
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
select
  review.stars
, tip.likes
from review inner join tip on review.user_id = tip.user_id
order by tip.likes desc;
